	abstract = {Web Application Firewalls are widely used in production
	            environments to mitigate security threats like SQL
	            injections. Many industrial products rely on signature-based
	            techniques, but machine learning approaches are becoming more
	            and more popular. The main goal of an adversary is to craft
	            semantically malicious payloads to bypass the syntactic
	            analysis performed by a WAF.In this paper, we present
	            WAF-A-MoLE, a tool that models the presence of an adversary.
	            This tool leverages on a set of mutation operators that alter
	            the syntax of a pay load without affecting the original
	            semantics. We evaluate the performance of the tool against
	            existing WAFs, that we trained using our publicly available
	            SQL query dataset. We show that WAF-A-MoLE bypasses all the
	            considered machine learning based WAFs.},
