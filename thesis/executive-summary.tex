\section{Executive Summary}
asd
The evasion techniques were used to try and create bypassing payloads that would evade the filtering of the evaluated firewall configuration. 
First, unobscured payloads were sent in HTTP requests towards the Web application firewall.
At this point, the firewall logs were inspected
Then, payloads were created using a single iteration of applying a single evasion technique to determine which evasion techniques are most effective. At this point, some created payloads already bypassed the evaluted firewall configuration.
Afterwards, evasion techniques determined to be effective were used in combination across multiple iterations to eventually create bypassing payloads.
In total, multiple bypassing payloads could be created. Those were sent in HTTP requests towards the evaluated firewall configuration, bypassed it and reached a testing Web application that should have been proted by the firewall configuration.

It was discovered that 13 of 18 evasion techniques are effective, some only in combination with other evasion techniques. 
When a created payloads was sent in a request towards the evaluated firewall configuration and blocked by the very same, the firewall log was inspected to determine why a payload caused the request to get blocked by the firewall.
