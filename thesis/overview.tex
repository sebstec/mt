\subsection{Overview and Scope}
To answer the afromentioned question, this work aims at evaluating web application firewalls using firewall evasion techniques. Firewall Evasion techniques are used by attackers specifically targeting a Web Application behind a Web Application Firewall. Attackers try to evade detection by using these techniques. 
% Firewall Evasion techniques will be detailed in the further course of this work. 

While malicious request containing payloads without obfuscation are certainly of importance, this work will focus on targeted attacks using payloads that were obscured using Firewall Evasion techniques.
% In Section~\ref{sec:fundamentals}, fundamentals regarding Web Applications, Web Application Security, Web Application Firewalls and Web Application Firewall Evasion will be detailed.
Following this, in Section~\ref{sec:firewallevasiontechniques}, Firewall Evasion techniques will be discussed. The focus is on Cross-Site Scripting. 

An iterative approach will be developed to try and bypass a number of web application firewalls using evasion techniques. Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} and Section~\ref{sec:EvaluationResults} will describe the evaluation methodology and evaluation results. In this context, this work aims at investigating the development steps of bypassing payloads and discussing occuring payload limitations in the context of tested firewall configurations and used firewall evasion techniques. Section~\ref{sec:rulesproposal} will detail proposed rule additions based on found bypassing payloads.

Subsequently, a generic evaluation proposal will be presented in Section~\ref{sec:proposal}. Finally, this work will be concluded (Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}) and ideas for further reasearch will be proposed (Section~\ref{sec:continuations}). In this work, no LLM-based or other machine learning approaches are pursued. Nonetheless, these approaches are promising and will be mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:continuations}.

Initially, in the following section, Section~\ref{sec:fundamentals}, fundamentals regarding Web Applications, Web Application Security, Web Application Firewalls and Web Application Firewall Evasion will be detailed.
