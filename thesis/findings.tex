\section{Evaluation Results}
\label{sec:EvaluationResults}
Evaluation has been conducted like stated in \ref{sec:evaluation}. 
All mentioned firewall evasion strategies were tested in at least one test-payload.
All payloads sent have been tested for validity.

From a total of {\color{red} W } requests sent after a single iteration of modification with an evasion technique, {\color{red} X } successfully bypassed the firewall. 

From a total of {\color{red} Y } requests sent after multiple iterations of modification with evasion techniques, {\color{red} Z } successfully bypassed the firewall.
