Firewall evasion is a tricky topic. A lot of influencing factors: Firewall, Configuration, Payload (Language, Type, Input Options), Blackbox or Whitebox.

Based on the proposed evaluation technique, the question is answered by X of Y malicious requests have been filtered previously to the implementation of derived rules. This result increased by Z\% to A of B malicious requests after the implementation of derived rules. For a complete overview, theoretically all potentially malicious payloads modified by all applicable evasion techniques would be neccessary. Still, the results allow an estimation of the firewall performance. Using the proposed evaluation technique allows to explore potential loopholes in the rules configuration. This give insight into performace and subsequently allows to close those loopholes by implementing new rules.
